🔕 DoNotDisturb++

DoNotDisturb++ is a VS Code extension designed to help you focus deeply by taking control of your notifications — instead of letting them control you.

Rather than simply muting everything, DoNotDisturb++ lets you categorize notifications by importance and context, so you stay informed without breaking your flow. Critical alerts get through. Noise stays out.

Built for developers who care about productivity, clarity, and uninterrupted focus.
